I closed the phone .	I 1233815001 the 1277599001 .
A cold front must have hit while I was inside .	A 1234347001 1249223008 must 1253820034 hit while I 1225404003 1258320011 .
After I 'd walked about a block , a car rolled up behind me .	After I 'd 1304921001 1219359009 a 1227187009 , a car 1285622011 up behind me .
It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry .	It slowed down as it neared me and I 1293930001 to 1307166001 .
This was n't the best of neighborhoods .	This 1225404008 n't the best of neighborhoods .
I heard an automatic window roll down .	I heard an 1223940001 1306540001 1285622011 1241795001 .
I turned around .	I 1301051001 1223011007 .
`` It 's a long way to anywhere worth going , '' he said .	`` It 's a 1264221001 1305429005 to anywhere worth 1251252001 , '' he 1287486001 .
I glanced back over my shoulder .	I 1250995001 1224262014 over my 1290274001 .
I stopped and looked back at him , surprised .	I 1294654001 and 1264302001 1224262014 at him , surprised .
He met my eyes coolly .	He met my 1245832001 coolly .
I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat .	I 1304921001 around the car and 1250696019 into the passenger 1288323001 .
Before I had my belt on , we were rolling forward .	Before I had my 1225866001 1273365024 , we 1225404014 rolling 1248624001 .
`` Okay , '' I said .	`` Okay , '' I 1287486001 .
He turned onto the next street and shifted up .	He 1301051001 onto the next street and shifted up .
I shivered .	I 1290074001 .
Something in his tone could n't be disbelieved .	Something in his 1299292001 1230339001 n't 1225404015 disbelieved .
My driver took a deep breath .	My 1242119001 1296844041 a 1238936001 breath .
Their bumpers looked ready to drop off , and their paint was half smog .	Their 1229417001 1264302013 1283265001 to drop off , and their 1275005001 1225404008 half smog .
I got a strange feeling that we were n't supposed to be driving here .	I 1250696001 a 1294816001 1246559004 that we were n't 1295947007 to 1225404014 1242109001 1254554001 .
`` You 'll be used to the sensation in a moment . ''	`` You 'll be 1303226009 to the 1289073001 in a 1268778001 . ''
That just unnerved me more .	That 1260351008 unnerved me 1269205005 .
As we kept driving , the anxiety grew more pronounced .	As we 1260682006 1242109001 , the anxiety 1252535006 more pronounced .
He parked and got out .	He parked and 1250696019 out .
Someone opened it a crack , then ushered us in .	Someone 1273535045 it a 1236776001 , 1298166002 1303240005 us in .
Inside , the building opened up .	1258320011 , the 1229308001 opened up .
It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub .	It 1264302013 like we were in the 1224262008 of a nightclub .
Then I looked down and saw what had let us in .	1298166002 I 1264302001 1241795001 and 1428150001 what 1253820034 1263073001 us in .
`` Nepthys , my man ! What up ? ''	`` Nepthys , my man ! What up ? ''
`` Nice , my man , '' he said as they clasped hands .	`` Nice , my man , '' he 1287486001 as they 1233532001 1253370001 .
The hunchbacked man came up to my stomach .	The hunchbacked 1265688001 came 1302984011 to my 1294584001 .
His skin was brown and stretched , like some diseased sapling 's bark .	His 1291152001 1225404008 brown and 1294926001 , like some diseased sapling 's 1224918001 .
Under matted hair , his eyes had slit pupils .	Under 1266534001 hair , his 1245832001 1253820001 slit 1281878001 .
Nepthys quickly answered for me .	Nepthys quickly 1222029007 for me .
`` Bummer . So , what 's the cat look like ? ''	`` Bummer . So , what 's the 1231228001 1264302013 like ? ''
He turned to me .	He 1301051001 to me .
It was easier to talk than to question .	It 1225404008 1242926001 to talk than to question .
They nodded .	They 1271694001 .
`` Oh , totally , '' said the hunchback .	`` Oh , totally , '' 1287486001 the hunchback .
`` I get that all the time around here . ''	`` I 1250696001 that all the time around 1254554001 . ''
The two glanced at each other .	The two 1250995001 at each 1274198001 .
`` What do you think ? '' asked the hunchback .	`` What do you 1298366001 ? '' 1223272001 the hunchback .
That last one was to me .	That last one 1225404008 to me .
I waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left .	I 1305390001 goodbye to the hunchback as we 1262701001 .
Thirty - five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed .	Thirty - five 1298358001 fingers 1305390001 lazily like seaweed .
I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was walking backwards .	I noticed when my 1224262001 1255154001 the wall that I 1225404014 1304921001 1224364005 .
`` Are you coming ? ''	`` 1225404008 you 1234657001 ? ''
`` Would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs ? '' it asked .	`` 1307187005 the 1250541004 1230840005 to 1281893001 some 1247113001 1254522001 ? '' it 1223272001 .
`` We 're not here to browse , '' Nepthys told him .	`` We 're not 1254554001 to 1229064001 , '' Nepthys 1297608001 him .
`` We 'd like to see a man about some garlic . ''	`` We 'd 1263474002 to 1428150015 a 1265688001 about some garlic . ''
The thing frowned .	The thing frowned .
It hissed thoughtfully .	It hissed thoughtfully .
`` Thank you . ''	`` Thank you . ''
Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart .	Nepthys 1228213001 1291403001 and we 1304921001 behind the cart .
The latch opened under Nepthys '' left hand with a clack !	The latch 1273535045 under Nepthys '' left 1253370001 with a clack !
The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs .	The door 1296844023 us to the 1228105001 of a flight of 1306923001 stairs .
At the top was one door .	At the 1299383001 was one door .
We entered .	We 1244298001 .
On the bed was a small , ratty man .	On the 1225562001 was a small , ratty 1265688001 .
I smelled matted hair and cedar chips .	I 1291625005 1266534001 1253108004 and cedar 1232769001 .
He opened one eye when we came in but did not move .	He 1273535045 one 1245832001 when we 1234657001 in but 1241237035 not 1269570001 .
`` We 're here for information about a vampire , '' said Nepthys .	`` We 're 1254554001 for 1258019001 about a 1303469001 , '' 1287486001 Nepthys .
`` Oh , shit ! ''	`` Oh , 1290048011 ! ''
I said .	I 1287486001 .
I shut up and tried to breathe .	I shut up and 1300736001 to breathe .
He continued to lie in place , still breathing heavily .	He 1235657001 to 1263316001 in 1278491001 , 1294414007 breathing 1419490003 .
I tried to keep myself calm .	I 1300736001 to 1260682006 myself 1230210001 .
`` Of course we will fetch you the stone , '' Nepthys assured him .	`` Of course we 1306429001 1246761001 you the stone , '' Nepthys 1223420001 him .
`` You have our thanks . ''	`` You have our thanks . ''
Outside , the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone .	1274419013 , the thing at the 1254522001 cart 1271694001 when we mentioned the stone .
Nepthys did n't need to warn me not to speak to them .	Nepthys 1241237035 n't 1270832003 to warn me 1272156001 to 1292860001 to them .
A large woman , similarly decorated , quickly drifted up to us .	A 1262244001 woman , similarly 1238883001 , quickly 1242078001 up to us .
`` Good evening , gentlemen , '' she said .	`` Good evening , 1250541004 , '' she 1287486001 .
She raised an eyebrow .	She 1282868001 an eyebrow .
The woman laughed .	The woman laughed .
`` Why , the merchandise , of course , '' she said .	`` Why , the merchandise , of course , '' she 1287486001 .

`` This is a slave shop , '' he explained quietly .	`` This 1225404008 a slave shop , '' he explained quietly .
The woman paused before another door , this one not barred but locked .	The woman paused before another door , this one 1272156001 1224811022 but 1264054009 .
`` Here it is , '' she said .	`` Here it 1225404008 , '' she 1287486001 .
`` A marvel , is n't it ? '' she said .	`` A marvel , 1225404008 n't it ? '' she 1287486001 .
`` That it is , '' Nepthys assured her .	`` That it 1225404008 , '' Nepthys 1223420001 her .
`` What would convince you to part with it ? ''	`` What 1307187002 convince you to part with it ? ''
She considered this , looking him over .	She considered this , 1264302001 him over .
I have never felt so appraised in all my life .	I have 1271178001 1246555010 1291940001 appraised in all my 1263339012 .
`` Half a pint , then -- and his hair . ''	`` Half a pint , 1298166004 -- and his 1253108004 . ''
Nepthys turned to me .	Nepthys 1301051001 to me .
`` As if I wanted it , '' interrupted the woman .	`` As if I 1305040001 it , '' 1258723001 the woman .
I thought about it , then nodded .	I 1298366004 about it , 1298166002 1271694001 .
`` Marvelous ! '' cried the woman .	`` Marvelous ! '' cried the woman .
She took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping .	She 1296844023 us downstairs to a small 1285748003 behind a 1283568001 silk 1241979005 .
`` Roll up your sleeves , '' she told me .	`` 1285622022 up your sleeves , '' she 1297608001 me .
It must have been larger than my finger .	It 1270091001 have 1225404008 1262244001 than my finger .
She laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm .	She 1262510001 it gently inside the hollow of my 1262777001 1222931001 .
I thought that I could feel a slight itching .	I thought that I 1236433001 1246555010 a 1291402001 itching .
Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber .	1298166002 she clapped her 1253370001 and brought in the barber .
At least the barber had n't nicked me .	At 1262681003 the barber had n't 1271392005 me .
I left not a little unnerved , and still woozy from the leeches .	I 1262701001 1272156001 a little unnerved , and 1294414007 woozy from the 1262757001 .
We hit a bar on the next street over .	We 1255154010 a 1224811008 on the next street over .
`` That should help , '' he said .	`` That 1290273001 1254325001 , '' he 1287486001 .

He thought about that .	He 1298366004 about that .
`` What do you mean ? '' `` Okay , take elves . ''	`` What 1241237035 you 1266763001 ? '' `` Okay , 1296844001 elves . ''
He caught the bartender 's eye for another shot .	He 1231288015 the bartender 's 1245832001 for another 1290256015 .
He downed the second shot .	He 1241795041 the 1288373001 1290256015 .

As we left the bar , I asked to see the rock .	As we 1262701001 the 1224811008 , I 1223272001 to 1428150001 the 1285485001 .
`` Why ? ''	`` 1306302001 ? ''
Nepthys asked .	Nepthys 1223272001 .

`` I agree , '' I told him .	`` I 1220472001 , '' I 1297608001 him .
`` Do you know what this thing does ? ''	`` 1241237035 you 1261363001 what this 1298362001 1241237001 ? ''
I shouted , hardly able to hear myself .	I 1290289001 , 1253577001 1219312001 to hear myself .
Then I opened my eyes again and saw a girl lying in the street .	1298166002 I 1273535045 my 1245832001 again and 1428150001 a 1250925003 1263316001 in the street .
There was no sign of the stone .	There 1225404001 no sign of the stone .

I opened my mouth to ask for an explanation , but Nepthys stopped me .	I 1273535045 my 1269553001 to 1223272001 for an explanation , but Nepthys stopped me .
I was at a loss .	I 1225404008 at a loss .
I 'd never named anyone before .	I 'd 1271178001 1270390005 anyone 1225686001 .
Nepthys looked at me incredulously .	Nepthys 1264302001 at me incredulously .
I stood up and Amy stood with me .	I 1293803001 up and Amy 1293803001 with me .
We walked back to the herb stand .	We 1304921001 back to the 1254522001 1293803028 .
`` What ! '' he screamed .	`` What ! '' he screamed .
We left .	We 1262701001 .
Walking outside , I was shocked to see that it was already dark .	1304921001 1274419013 , I was shocked to 1428150001 that it 1225404008 1221184001 1238353001 .
Amy liked it , I think .	Amy 1263474001 it , I 1298366001 .
His eyes were white .	His 1245832001 1225404008 1306086001 .

I had an urge to cover Amy 's eyes .	I had an urge to 1236650001 Amy 's 1245832001 .
`` The girl is ... surprising , '' he concluded .	`` The 1250925003 1225404008 ... surprising , '' he 1235148004 .
It seemed appropriate .	It seemed appropriate .
She laughed , liquid , alluring , alarming .	She laughed , 1263743005 , alluring , alarming .
Nepthys poured out wine for three of us .	Nepthys poured out wine for three of us .
I asked .	I 1223272001 .

Isis '' nostrils twitched slightly .	Isis '' nostrils 1301251001 1291403001 .
Amy , still holding my hand , smiled .	Amy , 1294414007 1255308001 my 1253370001 , smiled .

`` Now I understand why you 're here , '' said Isis .	`` 1272258001 I 1301959001 1306302003 you 're 1254554001 , '' 1287486001 Isis .
`` Mmm , '' she replied .	`` Mmm , '' she replied .
I could n't tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant .	I could n't 1297608007 what the thoughtful 1264302019 on her 1245912001 1266763001 .
Nepthys looked at me .	Nepthys 1264302001 at me .
`` You do ? ''	`` You 1241237035 ? ''
Nepthys could hardly believe her .	Nepthys could 1253577001 1225789001 her .
She sat up , running her hands along her pale , round thighs .	She 1291002001 up , 1286272011 her 1253370001 along her 1275076001 , 1285965003 thighs .
Isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands .	Isis 1233815001 her 1245832001 and 1263385001 her 1253370001 .
A dark glow coalesced around her palms .	A dark glow coalesced around her 1275159001 .
Amy leaned forward , looking amazed .	Amy leaned 1248624001 , 1264302013 amazed .
Her candy lips twisted into a frown .	Her candy 1263700001 1301240001 into a frown .
In her palms , the droplets of blood swelled into small pools .	In her 1275159001 , the droplets of 1227219001 swelled into small 1279486001 .
The pools in her hands grew deeper .	The 1279486001 in her 1253370001 1252535006 deeper .
Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake .	1298166002 her fingers tensed and her 1222931001 1225705001 to 1289619001 .
The blood in her palms , still filling up , began to ripple .	The 1227219001 in her 1275159001 , 1294414007 filling up , 1225705001 to ripple .
I did n't know .	I 1241237035 n't 1261363001 .
Isis collapsed on the fur , strings cut .	Isis 1234411006 on the 1249590001 , 1294968001 1237850008 .
Now Nepthys lunged forward , took her by the arms .	1272258001 Nepthys 1264805004 1248624001 , 1296844001 her by the 1222931001 .
`` Isis , what happened ? Are you hurt ? ''	`` Isis , what 1253509001 ? 1225404008 you hurt ? ''
`` What did you say ? '' asked Nepthys .	`` What 1241237035 you 1287486001 ? '' 1223272001 Nepthys .
She rolled onto her back , her arms crossed tightly over her chest .	She 1285622001 onto her 1224262001 , her 1222931001 1237199020 tightly over her 1232499001 .
For the first time , she looked vulnerable .	For the 1247284001 1298880023 , she 1264302013 vulnerable .
When she finally spoke , I had to lean close to hear her .	1305963004 she finally 1292860001 , I had to lean close to hear her .
She turned to me with tired sympathy .	She 1301051001 to me with tired 1296479001 .
A twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants .	A 1301251004 of her fingers summoned her 1275076001 servants .

Dvorov glanced over his shoulder , a little nervous .	Dvorov 1250995001 over his 1290274001 , a little 1271040001 .
Nepthys stepped in and Dvorov walked us towards the dance floor .	Nepthys 1294221018 in and Dvorov 1304921016 us towards the dance 1247829001 .

I tried to slip along the edge of the crowd .	I 1300736001 to 1291420001 along the 1243132001 of the crowd .
My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat .	My 1272117001 filled with a 1283770004 of thick 1296228001 .
The music began to build , and a strobe came on .	The music 1225705001 to build , and a 1295005001 1234657009 1273365030 .

Its haunches twitched in time to the music .	Its 1253796001 1301251001 in time to the music .
I thought that my odds were better on the dance floor .	I 1298366001 that my odds 1225404008 1226175001 on the dance 1247829001 .

`` You seen enough , man ? '' he shouted .	`` You 1428150001 enough , man ? '' he 1290289001 .

My arms shook from the force of his throw .	My 1222931001 1289619001 from the force of his 1298601026 .

Many healthy older adults report gradual weight gain throughout adult life .	Many healthy 1273160001 adults 1284331001 gradual 1305598001 gain throughout adult life .
Materials and methods Study design :	Materials and methods 1295106005 1239718001 :
Data were available about 93 % of the time .	1238419001 1225404008 available 1219359009 93 % of the 1298880021 .
Covariates The goal is to examine the association of YOL and YHL with BMI .	Covariates The 1251257004 1225404008 to 1245361001 the 1223399006 of YOL and YHL with BMI .
These measures are explained in more detail elsewhere ( 21 22 23 24 ) .	These measures are explained in more detail elsewhere ( 21 22 23 24 ) .
Analysis All analyses were performed separately for men and women .	Analysis All analyses were 1276921001 separately for 1265688001 and women .
We calculated two sets of adjusted values , as follows .	We 1230110001 two 1289371001 of 1219979001 1303448007 , as follows .
Adjusted YHL was calculated in a similar manner .	Adjusted YHL was 1230110001 in a similar 1265852001 .
Results Table 1shows the distribution of key variables by sex and race .	Results 1296660006 1shows the distribution of key variables by 1289462003 and 1282615001 .
There was thus substantial change in EVGFP over time , in both directions .	There was 1298662001 1295386001 1232051017 in EVGFP over 1298880005 , in both 1240575001 .
Whites in the sample had higher income and education ( data not shown ) .	1306086023 in the sample 1253820001 1254840009 income and 1243185001 ( 1238419001 not 1290298001 ) .
We next examined the relationship of BMI to YOL and YHL .	We next 1245361001 the relationship of BMI to YOL and YHL .
Subsequent analyses are adjusted only for age , race , and former smoking .	Subsequent analyses are 1219979001 1273443001 for 1220381001 , 1282615001 , and 1248537001 smoking .
Figure 1is a plot of adjusted YOL and YHL by sex and BMI .	1246988010 1is a 1278839004 of adjusted YOL and YHL by 1289462003 and BMI .
For each BMI category the mean and its 95 % confidence interval are plotted .	For each BMI 1231320001 the 1266765001 and its 95 % confidence 1258750001 are 1278839008 .
The bars are slightly offset to permit all error bars to be seen .	The bars 1225404008 1291403001 1273022011 to permit all error bars to be 1428150001 .
Men classified as normal , overweight or obese all had about the same YOL .	1265688001 classified as 1271996001 , overweight or obese all 1253820001 about the same YOL .
The lowermost two lines in Figure 1show mean YHL for women and men .	The lowermost two 1263591001 in 1246988010 1show mean YHL for women and 1265688001 .
Women who were normal or overweight averaged about 4.9 YHL .	Women who 1225404008 1271996001 or overweight averaged 1219359009 4.9 YHL .
The effect size is thus ( 4.92 - 4.50 ) / 1.44 = .29 .	The 1243233001 1291061001 1225404008 1298662001 ( 4.92 - 4.50 ) / 1.44 = .29 .
The biggest effect sizes are in the first row , comparing underweight to normal .	The 1226340001 1243233001 1291061001 1225404001 in the 1247284001 1286030001 , 1234902001 underweight to 1271996001 .
Interestingly , the strongest health relationships were found for underweight older adults .	Interestingly , the 1295023008 health relationships 1225404015 1247107008 for underweight 1273160001 adults .
Both YOL and YHL would be clinically significant in this patient group .	Both YOL and YHL would 1225404008 1233736001 1290641001 in this patient group .
These results are for a 7 - year follow - up .	These results are for a 7 - 1307589002 follow - up .
Conclusion Recommendations for desirable weight have been criticized for emphasizing mortality rather than health .	Conclusion Recommendations for desirable 1305598001 1253820034 1225404015 1237132001 for emphasizing 1269291002 1283099004 than health .

`` In recession , face brutal facts , thrive ''	`` In 1283421001 , 1245912017 brutal facts , thrive ''
By Jim Collins	By Jim Collins
As I read the book , I found myself getting depressed .	As I 1283249001 the 1227849001 , I found myself 1250696013 depressed .
And then it dawned on me :	And 1298166001 it 1238497005 on me :
Finally , I asked , `` Who did n't make it out ? ''	Finally , I 1223272001 , `` Who 1241237035 n't make it out ? ''
`` Oh , that 's easy , '' he said .	`` Oh , that 's 1242926001 , '' he 1287486001 .
`` The optimists . ''	`` The optimists . ''
`` The optimists ?	`` The optimists ?
I do n't understand , '' I said , completely confused .	I 1241237035 n't 1301959001 , '' I 1287486001 , completely confused .
`` The optimists .	`` The optimists .
' And Christmas would come , and Christmas would go .	' And Christmas 1307187001 1234657009 , and Christmas 1307187001 1251252015 .
Then they 'd say , ' We 're going to be out by Easter .	1298166002 they 'd 1287486001 , ' We 're going to 1225404008 out by Easter .
' And Easter would come , and Easter would go .	' And Easter 1307187001 1234657009 , and Easter 1307187001 1251252015 .
And then Thanksgiving , and then it would be Christmas again .	And 1298166002 Thanksgiving , and 1298166002 it 1307187001 1225404008 Christmas again .
And they died of a broken heart . ''	And they 1240230001 of a 1228919002 1254038001 . ''
What can we potentially do better than any other company in the world ?	What 1230339001 we potentially 1241237001 1226175006 than any 1274198001 1234891001 in the 1307108001 ?
What can best drive our economic engine ?	What 1230339001 1226116004 drive our 1243053001 1244160001 ?
What best ignites the passions of our people ?	What 1226116001 ignites the 1275946001 of our people ?
Their companies will begin to die of a broken heart .	Their 1234891001 1306429001 1225705001 to 1240230001 of a 1228919002 1254038001 .
It need not be this way .	It 1270832003 1272156001 be this way .
The choice is yours .	The choice 1225404008 yours .

And this may be the most important point .	And this 1266614001 1225404008 the 1269360005 important 1279055019 .
It is a pity to see each protocol tackle the problem its own way .	It 1225404008 a 1278452002 to 1428150001 each 1281329001 tackle the 1280894001 its 1274748001 way .

We argue here that the answer is an emphatic `` yes '' .	We 1222864001 1254554001 that the answer 1225404008 an emphatic `` yes '' .
The interplay may seem downright chaotic .	The interplay 1266614001 seem downright chaotic .
Further examination reveals not only order , but remarkable stability .	1249623011 1245359001 reveals not 1273443001 1273820001 , but remarkable stability .
In this chapter we set out to explore the pervasive nature of boundaryless careers .	In this 1232115001 we 1289370016 out to explore the pervasive 1270646005 of boundaryless careers .
We then examine the industry cases .	We 1298166002 1245361001 the 1257864001 1231100001 .
An enactment perspective	An 1243937003 1277185005

Similarly , career systems evolve from the enactment of individual careers .	Similarly , career 1296611009 1245330001 from the 1243937003 of 1257786002 careers .
In response they may sense that fear and behave in a hostile manner .	In response they 1266614001 sense that fear and 1225722001 in a hostile 1265852001 .
The environment becomes hostile .	The 1244401001 1225557001 hostile .
Moreover , you have contributed to `` enacting '' that hostile environment .	Moreover , you 1253820034 contributed to `` 1243936001 '' that hostile 1244401001 .
How do we relate this process to boundaryless careers ?	1256048001 do we 1284058002 this 1280909001 to boundaryless careers ?
Instead of providing clear guidelines , employment situations are characterised by ambiguity .	Instead of 1281380001 1233608001 guidelines , employment situations 1225404008 1232135002 by ambiguity .

However , our examples suggest subtler forces are at work .	1256065001 , our 1245362001 suggest subtler 1248351001 are at work .
The concept of reciprocity reinforces the significance of project - based activities .	The concept of reciprocity reinforces the 1290640001 of 1281039001 - 1225073025 activities .
Yet , the benefits of reciprocity can accrue beyond the project 's conclusion .	Yet , the 1225926001 of reciprocity 1230339001 accrue beyond the 1281039001 's 1235149001 .

There are deep reasons for caution .	There are 1238936008 1283330001 for 1231446001 .
Hume told us long ago about the `` naturalistic fallacy '' :	Hume 1297608001 us 1264221025 ago about the `` 1270629002 fallacy '' :
One can not deduce `` ought '' from `` is . ''	One 1230339001 1272156001 deduce `` ought '' from `` is . ''

So , a short soliloquy .	1291940012 , a short soliloquy .
Facts are know - that statements .	Facts 1225404008 1261363001 - that statements .
But know - how preceded know that .	But 1261363001 - how preceded 1261363001 that .
I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria .	I 1295947001 we 1222532007 the Darwinian criteria .

- If nesting is possible , every nesting level has its own counter .	- If nesting 1225404008 possible , every nesting 1263147001 1253820001 its 1274748001 1236463004 .
- From the values of the counter ( s ) a label is calculated .	- From the 1303448007 of the 1236463004 ( s ) a 1261689001 is 1230110001 .

There are ( at least ) the following exceptions to the algorithm described above :	There 1225404001 ( at 1262681003 ) the 1248196004 exceptions to the algorithm 1239683001 above :

One possibility for this is to give the	One possibility for this 1225404008 to 1250951015 the
start tag a new attribute that specifies the labels of the individual components .	1293930020 1296758016 a new 1223702010 that specifies the 1261689001 of the 1257786001 components .
This enables generation of the labels of the sub-figures .	This enables 1250445005 of the 1261689001 of the sub-figures .
First an example of a regular case :	First an 1245362001 of a 1283968013 1231100001 :

If we add an attribute to the start tag we can achieve this :	If we 1219879001 an 1223702010 to the 1293930020 1296758001 we 1230339001 achieve this :

Unfortunately , the attribute	Unfortunately , the 1223702010

Now we have the following ( id , label ) pairs :	1272258001 we 1253820001 the 1248196004 ( id , 1261689001 ) pairs :
